 * This is very portable in the sense that it'll compile on almost anything,

 * Finally, the total space already allocated is passed.  If no better
 * method is available, cinfo->mem->max_memory_to_use - already_allocated
 * is often a suitable calculation.
 *
 * It is OK for jpeg_mem_available to underestimate the space available
